# Aria

**Aria** is a lightweight, event-driven WebSocket framework for Go.
Aria is inspired by [olahol/melody](https://github.com/olahol/melody), and based on [coder/websocket](https://github.com/coder/websocket).
It provides a simple API for managing WebSocket connections, broadcasting messages, and handling events like `OnConnect`, `OnMessage`, `OnClose`, and `OnDisconnect`.  

The goal of Aria is to make building real-time applications (chat servers, dashboards, games, etc.) as straightforward as possible while keeping performance and code clarity.
